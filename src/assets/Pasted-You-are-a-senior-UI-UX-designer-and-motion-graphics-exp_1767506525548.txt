You are a senior UI/UX designer and motion graphics expert specializing in 
cyberpunk, futuristic, and neon-tech interfaces.

Design a complete website UI for a college technical event named 
"INNIXO – OVERDRIVE 2026".

THEME & VISUAL STYLE:
• Cyberpunk / Neon Tech / Futuristic
• Dark background (deep black / midnight blue)
• Neon accent colors (electric cyan, neon purple, magenta, toxic green)
• High contrast UI with glowing edges
• Glassmorphism + subtle grain texture
• Tech grid overlays and glitch effects
• Modern rounded typography with sci-fi feel

TYPOGRAPHY:
• Headings: Orbitron / Oxanium / Space Grotesk
• Body text: Inter / Poppins
• Use uppercase headings with wide letter spacing
• Neon text glow for important titles

• Glass panels: rgba(255,255,255,0.08)

MOTION & ANIMATIONS (VERY IMPORTANT):
• Smooth page transitions (fade + slide)
• Hero section with animated neon lines and moving grids
• Hover animations on cards (glow + scale + tilt)
• Micro-interactions on buttons (pulse, ripple, neon flash)
• Scroll-triggered animations (text reveal, card lift)

• Loading animation with cyber-style progress indicator
• Floating particles or code fragments in background
